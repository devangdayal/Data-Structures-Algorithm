# Data Structures and Algorithm
 
Data Structures and Algorithm is one of the most important skillset any Aspiring CSE Engineer can possess. 

<em>A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.</em>

## Sorting Techniques

* Bubble Sorting Technique
  -  Bubble Sort is the sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are not in proper Order.

* Merge Sorting Technique
  - Merge Sort is the sorting algorithm in which firsty it divide the list into the smallest unit (1 element), then compare each element with the adjacent list to sort and merge the two adjacent lists. Finally all the elements are sorted and merged. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.

* Quick Sorting Technique
  - QuickSort is a sorting algorithm based on Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.
